# Define (DEFINE)

You're entering the DEFINE phase. The goal is to name the problem precisely — root causes, not symptoms — and set clear boundaries for what success looks like.

**This is where vague becomes specific.** Most bad solutions come from solving the wrong problem. This phase prevents that.

## The Method

### Separate symptoms from root causes

The thing someone notices is rarely the thing that's wrong.

- What's the observable symptom?
- Why is that happening? (Ask why multiple times)
- If I fixed this symptom, would the underlying problem still exist?
- Am I solving a cause or patching an effect?

### Write a problem statement

One to three sentences. If you can't state it concisely, you don't understand it yet.

- What's wrong or missing?
- Who does it affect?
- What's the impact of NOT solving it?

Test it: Would someone unfamiliar with the context understand the problem from this statement alone?

### Set the Definition of Done

What does success look like? Be specific enough to verify.

- How will we KNOW this is solved? What's the evidence?
- What's in scope and what's explicitly out?
- What's the minimum outcome that would be acceptable?
- What's the stretch outcome if things go well?

If you can't define done, you can't define the problem.

### Identify constraints and boundaries

Every problem lives inside constraints. Name them.

- What CAN'T change? (technical, organizational, time, budget, ethical)
- What's negotiable vs. fixed?
- What dependencies exist?
- What's the blast radius — what else gets affected by this change?

### Challenge the framing

The most dangerous assumption is that we're solving the right problem.

- Is this the highest-leverage problem to solve right now?
- Are we solving what's urgent or what's important?
- Would a different framing open up better solutions?
- Who defined this as the problem? What's their perspective? What might they be missing?
- Is this actually multiple problems pretending to be one?

## Outputs

By the end of DEFINE, you MUST have:

1. **Problem statement** — concise, precise, testable
2. **Root cause** — not symptoms
3. **Definition of Done** — how we'll know it's solved
4. **Scope boundaries** — what's in and what's out
5. **Constraints** — what we're working within

Present these to the user. Get alignment before moving on. Misalignment here costs the most.

## Moving On

You're ready for IDEATE when:
- The problem statement is specific (not "make it better")
- Root cause is identified (not symptom)
- Definition of Done exists and is verifiable
- The user agrees this is the right problem to solve

Update the GitHub issue with the problem definition if it's evolved from the original.
