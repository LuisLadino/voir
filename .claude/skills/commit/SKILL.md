# Commit

You're finishing work. This skill does the full flow:

```
Commit → Push → Create PR → Enable Auto-merge
```

GitHub merges automatically after CI checks pass.

## What to Do

### 1. Check What Changed

```bash
git status
git diff --staged
git diff
```

If nothing to commit, say so and stop.

### 2. Load Commit Format

Read `.claude/specs/config/version-control.md` if it exists.

If not found, use conventional commits: `type(scope): description`

Types: feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, chore

### 3. Documentation Check (MANDATORY — do not skip)

Before committing, verify documentation reflects the changes.

**Step 3a: Determine what changed.**

From the diff, classify the change:
- Feature or fix → CHANGELOG.md MUST have an entry
- Structural change (new dirs, renamed modules) → README.md likely needs updating
- API/interface change → component specs may be stale
- New component/module → component spec may be needed (see /sync-stack Step 9)

**Step 3b: Read and check each file.**

MUST read each file that exists. Do not assume "still accurate" without reading.

```bash
# Check if these exist and read them
cat CHANGELOG.md 2>/dev/null | head -30
cat README.md 2>/dev/null | head -40
ls .claude/specs/components/ 2>/dev/null
```

**Step 3c: Update what's stale.**

Document current state only. NEVER describe what changed — only what IS.

**Do not update:** `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` as part of commits. That file is user-scope personal instructions, not a doc that tracks code changes. Project-level and kit-synced CLAUDE.md can be updated when the change warrants.

**Step 3d: If a file should exist but doesn't** (e.g., no CHANGELOG.md in a project with features), create it.

**Step 3e: Report.** You MUST output a documentation check report before proceeding to Step 4:

```
DOCUMENTATION CHECK:
- CHANGELOG.md: [added entry / still accurate / created / N/A]
- README.md: [updated / still accurate / N/A]
- Component specs: [updated X / still accurate / N/A]
```

### 4. Stage and Commit

```bash
git add path/to/files
SKILL_ACTIVE=1 DOCS_CHECKED=1 git commit -m "type(scope): description"
```

Prefer specific files over `git add -A`.

**Note:** `SKILL_ACTIVE=1 DOCS_CHECKED=1` bypasses the enforce-skills hook. BOTH markers are required — the hook verifies you completed Step 3 (documentation check) before allowing the commit. Only use within this skill after completing Step 3.

### 5. Push

```bash
git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

### 6. Update Related Issues

If this work relates to a GitHub issue, comment on the issue with what was done.

Use `gh api` to avoid enforce-skills hook blocking:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/comments -f body="comment text"
```

**What to include:**
- What this commit accomplished toward the issue
- Discoveries or decisions made during the work
- What still needs doing or testing

This is how issues capture the design thinking journey. The commit message says WHAT changed. The issue comment says WHY and what we learned.

### 7. Create PR with Auto-merge

Extract issue number from branch name if present:

```bash
git branch --show-current | grep -oE '[0-9]+' | head -1
```

**Client-mode PR body scan.** If the project has `.claude/kit-mode.yaml` with `mode: client`, scan the PR body before creating the PR. The commit-msg hook covers commit messages, not PR bodies.

Compose the PR body into a shell variable first, then scan it, then pass it to `gh pr create`. The variable is required — scanning `gh pr create --body "string"` directly is not possible without capturing it.

```bash
PR_BODY=$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- What changed
- Why it changed

Addresses #X

## Test Plan
- How to verify
- [ ] Tested locally
EOF
)

if [ -f .claude/kit-mode.yaml ] && grep -q "^mode: client" .claude/kit-mode.yaml; then
  printf '%s' "$PR_BODY" | node .claude/hooks/safety/scan-attribution.cjs --stdin || {
    echo "PR body contains AI attribution. Revise PR_BODY and retry."
    exit 1
  }
fi

gh pr create --title "title" --body "$PR_BODY"
```

If the scan fails, edit the `PR_BODY` heredoc content to remove attribution, then re-run the scan and create steps.

**PR body format:**
```markdown
## Summary
- What changed
- Why it changed

Addresses #X

## Test Plan
- How to verify
- [ ] Tested locally
- [ ] Verified fix works
```

**Issue linking (commit ≠ close):**

- **`Closes #X`** — fix is tested and verified working. Issue can close on merge.
- **`Addresses #X`** — code is written but not yet verified. Issue stays open.
- **`Related to #X`** — partial progress. More work needed.

**Default to `Addresses`** - issues close when fixes are VERIFIED, not when code merges. Only use `Closes` when you've actually tested the fix works.

### 8. Enable Auto-merge

```bash
gh pr merge --auto --squash --delete-branch
```

This queues the PR to merge automatically after CI checks pass.

### 9. Watch CI and Deploy

After enabling auto-merge, spawn a background watcher. It notifies you when the ship settles — success or failure — without you having to check manually. This closes the gap where CI failures and broken deploys pass silently.

Extract the PR number and spawn the watcher via the `Monitor` tool:

```
PR=$(gh pr view --json number --jq .number)
```

```
Monitor({
  description: "Watching PR #${PR} CI + deploy",
  persistent: true,
  command: "bash .claude/hooks/lifecycle/watch-ship.sh ${PR}"
})
```

The watcher emits exactly one line on completion:

- `✓ PR #N merged + deploy healthy` — happy path, session stays quiet until then
- `✓ PR #N merged (no deploy check configured)` — projects without a deploy target
- `✗ PR #N — CI failed or merge blocked` — action needed, check `gh pr view N`
- `✗ PR #N merged but deploy unreachable` — revert or investigate

You don't wait for it. Continue with other work. The Monitor runs in the background for the rest of the session.

**Session-length limitation.** If you close the session before CI finishes, the Monitor dies with it. The `check-recent-ships.cjs` SessionStart hook catches this on the next session by scanning merged PRs from the last 24h.

### 10. Done

Show the PR URL. The Monitor continues in the background and will notify you when the ship settles.

## Deploy Configuration (optional)

To enable the post-merge health check, add a `deploy:` block to the project's `.claude/specs/stack-config.yaml`:

```yaml
deploy:
  url: "https://your-site.com"
```

When configured, the watcher curls this URL after merge and reports if the response isn't HTTP 2xx. Without it, the watcher skips the deploy check and only reports the merge outcome.

## Notes

- Each commit should be a logical unit
- Multiple commits get squashed on merge
- Branch auto-deletes after merge
- Requires: repo has branch protection rules allowing auto-merge
- The Monitor watcher runs `bash .claude/hooks/lifecycle/watch-ship.sh <PR>` — script is kit-synced
