# Plan

You're organizing work using GitHub Issues as the system of record.

GitHub Issues aren't just for bugs. They're for:
- Ideas to explore
- Features to build
- Technical debt to address
- Things to remember
- Anything that should be tracked

## Modes

This skill handles several planning activities. Detect what the user wants:

### "Create an issue" / "Add to backlog" / "New idea"
→ Go to **Create Issue**

### "What's next" / "What should I work on"
→ Go to **Review Backlog**

### "Let's plan" / "Prioritize" / "Organize"
→ Go to **Organize Backlog**

### "Create a milestone" / "Plan the release"
→ Go to **Manage Milestones**

## Create Issue

Capture something for tracking. **Issues are the system of record for WHY work happens.**

### 0. Check Issue Scope First

Before creating a new issue, ask: **Does this have a different Definition of Done than what we're currently working on?**

**Create NEW issue when:**
- Different Definition of Done than current work
- Could be solved independently
- Different component/domain
- Would significantly expand current scope

**DON'T create new issue when:**
- Same root problem (iterate on current issue)
- Bug found while testing (that's TEST → ITERATE)
- Refinement of approach
- DoD not yet met on current issue

If working on an issue and something comes up, default to **documenting in current issue** unless it clearly has a separate DoD.

### 1. Understand the Problem

Before creating an issue, understand:
- **What problem are we solving?** Not what to build, but what's wrong or missing.
- **Why does it matter?** What's the impact of not solving it?
- **What's the context?** How did we discover this? What's the background?

If the user just says "add X feature", ask: "What problem does X solve?"

### 2. Determine Issue Type and Labels

Standard labels:
- **Type:** `type/feature`, `type/bug`, `type/chore`, `type/idea`, `type/tech-debt`
- **Priority:** `priority/high`, `priority/medium`, `priority/low`
- **Status:** `status/backlog`, `status/ready`, `status/in-progress`

### 3. Create the Issue with Full Context

**The issue body must explain the problem clearly enough that someone reading it later (including Claude in a future session) understands WHY this work matters.**

**Important:** Prefix `gh issue create` with `SKILL_ACTIVE=1` to signal that the proper workflow was followed:

```bash
SKILL_ACTIVE=1 gh issue create \
  --title "type: Short description of what changes" \
  --body "## Problem

What's wrong or missing? What triggered this?
Be specific. Include error messages, user feedback, or observations.

## Why It Matters

What's the impact? What happens if we don't fix this?
Connect to user value or system health.

## Proposed Solution

How might we solve this? (Not required for ideas/exploration)
Include trade-offs if multiple approaches exist.

## Design Thinking Phase

Starting in **Understand** / **Define** / etc.

## Tasks

- [ ] First step
- [ ] Second step" \
  --label "type/feature,priority/medium,status/backlog"
```

**Required sections:**
- **Problem** - The actual issue, not a solution masquerading as a problem
- **Why It Matters** - Stakes and impact

**Optional sections:**
- **Proposed Solution** - If approach is known
- **Design Thinking Phase** - Where this work starts in the cycle
- **Tasks** - Breakdown if scope is clear
- **Definition of Done** - What does success look like? (Should be explicit by end of DEFINE phase)

### 4. Add to Milestone (Optional)

If there's an active milestone:
```bash
gh issue edit {number} --milestone "v0.1"
```

## Review Backlog

Help decide what to work on next.

### 1. Show Current State

```bash
# Open issues by priority
gh issue list --label "priority/high" --state open
gh issue list --label "priority/medium" --state open

# What's in progress?
gh issue list --label "status/in-progress" --state open

# Current milestone progress
gh issue list --milestone "v0.1" --state all
```

### 2. Recommend Next Steps

Based on:
- What's high priority and ready
- What's blocking other work
- What fits the current milestone

Suggest 1-3 issues to work on next.

## Organize Backlog

Clean up and prioritize.

### 1. Review All Open Issues

```bash
gh issue list --state open --limit 50
```

### 2. For Each Issue, Consider

- Is the priority still accurate?
- Does it belong in a milestone?
- Is it still relevant?
- Should it be closed?

### 3. Make Updates

```bash
# Update priority
gh issue edit {number} --add-label "priority/high" --remove-label "priority/low"

# Add to milestone
gh issue edit {number} --milestone "v0.1"

# Close if no longer relevant
gh issue close {number} --reason "not planned"
```

### 4. Summarize Changes

Report what was updated.

## Manage Milestones

Plan releases and group work.

### 1. View Current Milestones

```bash
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/milestones --jq '.[] | "\(.title): \(.open_issues) open, \(.closed_issues) closed"'
```

### 2. Create New Milestone

```bash
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/milestones \
  --method POST \
  --field title="v0.2" \
  --field description="Description of this release" \
  --field due_on="2024-04-01T00:00:00Z"
```

### 3. Move Issues to Milestone

```bash
gh issue edit {number} --milestone "v0.2"
```

## Quick Capture

If the user just mentions something in passing ("we should add X eventually"), quickly capture it:

```bash
SKILL_ACTIVE=1 gh issue create --title "Idea: X" --label "type/idea,status/backlog" --body "Captured from conversation. Needs refinement."
```

Then continue with whatever else was happening.

## Batched Issue Creation

When creating multiple issues at once, batch them in a script or compound command. The verify-before-stop hook scans recorded bash command strings, not the contents of script files, so a `bash /tmp/issues.sh` invocation hides the inner `gh issue create` calls.

Emit `echo 'SKILL_COMPLETE: plan'` after the batch so the hook accepts the work as complete:

```bash
cat > /tmp/issues.sh <<'EOF'
SKILL_ACTIVE=1 gh issue create --title "..." --body "..." --label "type/feature,priority/medium,status/backlog"
SKILL_ACTIVE=1 gh issue create --title "..." --body "..." --label "type/feature,priority/medium,status/backlog"
SKILL_ACTIVE=1 gh issue create --title "..." --body "..." --label "type/feature,priority/medium,status/backlog"
EOF
bash /tmp/issues.sh && echo 'SKILL_COMPLETE: plan'
```

The sentinel works for any skill the hook gates. Format: `SKILL_COMPLETE: <skill-name>`. Whitespace after the colon is optional. Match is case-sensitive and rejects prefix collisions, so `plan` does not satisfy a `plan-foo` skill.

If a single `SKILL_ACTIVE=1 gh issue create` runs as its own Bash tool call, the hook already detects completion and no sentinel is needed. Use the sentinel only when the natural completion signal is hidden by a script, dynamic command, or other indirection.

## Design Thinking and Issues

**GitHub Issues** are the system of record (persistent, survive sessions). The design thinking journey is captured through issue comments, not in-session task tools.

Traceability:
- Issue = WHY (the problem)
- Issue comments = HOW (decisions, discoveries, phase transitions)
- Changes = WHAT (the implementation)

The phase skills (/research, /define, /ideate, /build, /test) guide the work. Issue comments capture the journey.

## Issue Lifecycle

Issues track work from idea to completion. The issue body evolves:

### When Created
- Problem and context documented
- May not have solution yet

### When Work Starts (/research → /build)
- Issue loaded and researched (/research)
- Problem defined, approach chosen (/define → /ideate)
- Branch created, issue moved to "In Progress" (/build)
- **Tasks created for design thinking phases**

### When PR Created
- PR body includes "Closes #X"
- PR summarizes the implementation approach

### When Merged/Closed
- **PR description becomes the implementation record**
- Future readers can see: Problem (issue) → Solution (PR)
- If closing without PR, add comment explaining resolution

**The goal:** Anyone reading a closed issue understands both the problem AND how it was solved.

## Maintaining Issues During Work

**Issues are the persistent record of the design thinking journey.** Conversation context gets compacted; issue comments survive.

### When to Update the Issue

Write to the issue at these trigger points:

| Trigger | What Happened | What to Write |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| **Decision made** | Chose between options | Decision record (see template) |
| **Discovery** | Learned something significant | What we found + implications |
| **Phase transition** | Moving UNDERSTAND → DEFINE, etc. | Phase change + rationale |
| **Blocked** | Can't proceed | What's blocking + what we tried |
| **Going backward** | Need to revisit earlier phase | Why we're iterating + new questions |

### Comment Templates

**Use these formats for structured comments that future sessions can parse.**

#### Decision Record

When you make a non-obvious choice:

```markdown
## Decision: [Short title]

**Context:** What situation required a decision?
**Options considered:**
1. Option A - [brief description]
2. Option B - [brief description]
3. Option C - [brief description]

**Chosen:** Option [X]
**Rationale:** Why this option?
**Trade-offs:** What we're giving up or accepting
```

#### Discovery Log

When you learn something important:

```markdown
## Discovery: [What we found]

**Source:** Where did this come from? (code, docs, testing, conversation)
**Implication:** How does this affect our approach?
**Action:** What we're doing about it (or "No action needed - informational")
```

#### Phase Transition

When moving between design thinking phases:

```markdown
## Phase: [DEFINE] → [IDEATE]

**Completed in [DEFINE]:**
- [What we accomplished]
- [Key outputs/artifacts]

**Moving to [IDEATE] because:**
- [Why we're ready to transition]

**Questions for [IDEATE]:**
- [What we need to explore]
```

#### Iteration (Going Backward)

When returning to an earlier phase:

```markdown
## Iteration: [PROTOTYPE] → [UNDERSTAND]

**Trigger:** What caused us to go back?
**Discovery:** What we learned that invalidated assumptions
**Questions to re-examine:**
- [Question 1]
- [Question 2]
```

### Command to Add Comments

```bash
gh issue comment {number} --body "## Decision: ...

**Context:** ...
..."
```

### Why This Matters

1. **Session continuity** - Context compaction loses conversation details. Issues persist.
2. **Decision traceability** - Future you (or Claude) can see WHY choices were made.
3. **Iteration support** - When going backward, the trigger is documented.
4. **Self-correction** - Inconsistencies between issue context and code become visible.

### Example: Good vs Bad Issue Updates

**Bad (vague):**
```
Updated the hook to fix the issue.
```

**Good (actionable context):**
```
## Decision: Make Phase Evaluator async

**Context:** Phase Evaluator was blocking commits for 120+ seconds when doing research.
**Options considered:**
1. Increase timeout to 5 minutes
2. Reduce research scope
3. Make async with background worker

**Chosen:** Option 3 - async with background worker
**Rationale:** User asked "why can't we just run it in the background?" - valid point. The evaluation doesn't need to block the commit; results can be injected on next prompt.
**Trade-offs:** Results appear on next prompt instead of immediately after commit.
```

## Standard Labels Reference

Create these labels on new projects:

**Type:**
- `type/feature` - New functionality
- `type/bug` - Something broken
- `type/chore` - Maintenance, refactoring
- `type/idea` - Explore later
- `type/tech-debt` - Cleanup needed

**Priority:**
- `priority/high` - Do soon
- `priority/medium` - Normal
- `priority/low` - When time permits

**Status:**
- `status/backlog` - Not started
- `status/ready` - Ready to pick up
- `status/in-progress` - Being worked on
- `status/blocked` - Waiting on something
