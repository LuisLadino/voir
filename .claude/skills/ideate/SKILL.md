# Ideate (IDEATE)

You're entering the IDEATE phase. The goal is to generate genuinely different approaches, evaluate them honestly, and converge on a direction with eyes open.

**This is where most people skip.** They see the problem and jump to the first reasonable solution. The first idea is rarely the best idea — it's just the most available one.

## Before generating options for UI projects

If this is a UI project and `.claude/specs/design/direction.md` does not exist, offer `/design shape` before generating approaches. Direction precedes options. Exploring UI approaches without it produces options disconnected from project feel, brand voice, and motion posture.

Detect UI signals the same way `/design` does:
- Web: `package.json` with react, vue, svelte, next, nuxt, astro, angular, solid, or CSS/styling deps
- Microsoft/.NET: `*.csproj`, `*.sln`, `*.cshtml`, `*.razor`, `*.xaml`
- Mobile: `ios/` or `android/` directories, `*.storyboard`, `*.xib`
- Template engines: `*.hbs`, `*.ejs`, `*.pug`, `*.liquid`, `*.erb`, `*.twig`
- Source files: `*.tsx`, `*.jsx`, `*.vue`, `*.svelte`, `*.astro`, `*.mdx`, CSS variants

Skip this precondition if no UI signals present or if `/init-project` is currently active.

If UI signals present and `direction.md` missing:

```
DESIGN DIRECTION NOT SET

This project has UI but no direction.md. Ideation will produce options,
but they won't be anchored to project feel, brand voice, or motion posture.
/design shape establishes that anchor.

Options:
1. Run /design shape first, then return to ideation
2. Proceed without direction.md. Accept that options will be generic.
```

**WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** before continuing to The Method.

## The Method

### Generate at least three genuinely different approaches

Not three variations of the same idea. Different strategies, different trade-offs, different philosophies.

- What's the obvious approach? (Start here, but don't stop here)
- What's the opposite approach? (Invert the problem)
- What's the approach from a completely different lens? (How would a designer solve this? An engineer? A user? A business person?)
- What would you do with unlimited time? With only one hour?
- What's the approach you're avoiding? Why are you avoiding it?

### Evaluate honestly

For each approach:

- What's the actual trade-off? (Everything has a cost — name it)
- What's the effort vs. impact?
- What does this make easy? What does this make hard?
- What's the risk? What could go wrong?
- What assumptions does this approach depend on?
- How reversible is this? Can we change course later?

### Check for prior art

Before committing to an approach, see if the work is already done.

- Has this been solved before? (In this project, in other projects, in the industry)
- What can we learn from existing solutions?
- What's available to build on vs. what needs to be created?
- Is there a standard or convention for this that we should follow?

### Sit in the groan zone

The groan zone is the uncomfortable space between diverging and converging. Multiple options exist and none is clearly best. This is normal and valuable.

- Am I converging too early because the ambiguity is uncomfortable?
- Am I avoiding an option because it's harder, not because it's worse?
- What new information would make the choice clear?
- Is the tension between options revealing something about the problem we missed?

Do NOT escape the groan zone by:
- Removing requirements to make an option work
- Pretending trade-offs don't exist
- Picking the first option because "we need to move forward"
- Avoiding the hard question

### Converge with a recommendation

After genuine exploration, recommend a direction.

- Which approach best fits the constraints from DEFINE?
- Which approach best serves the Definition of Done?
- What are we giving up by choosing this? (Say it explicitly)
- What would make us change this decision later?

### Surface the decisions this approach requires

**This is the gate.** Before declaring readiness for build, you MUST surface every decision the chosen approach requires. These aren't trade-offs (you already covered those). These are the specific choices that need to be made to implement this approach.

For each decision, state:
- **What's being decided** — the specific choice (tool, pattern, structure, dependency, convention)
- **What you're choosing** — your recommendation and why
- **What this locks in** — what becomes hard to change once you start building around this choice

Present these to the user. They don't need domain expertise to evaluate them — they need to see the decisions laid out clearly enough to challenge any that feel wrong.

Do NOT:
- Bundle decisions into the approach recommendation. "We're going with option 2" is the approach. "Option 2 means choosing X for the database and Y for the API pattern" are the decisions.
- Defer decisions to build. If a decision must be made to start building, make it now.
- Skip this because the decisions "seem obvious." Obvious to you is not obvious to the user.

## Outputs

By the end of IDEATE, you MUST have:

1. **Options explored** — at least 3 genuinely different approaches
2. **Trade-off analysis** — honest costs and benefits of each
3. **Recommendation** — which approach and why
4. **What we're giving up** — explicit acknowledgment of trade-offs
5. **Reversal conditions** — what would make us reconsider
6. **Decisions required** — every decision the chosen approach needs, what you're choosing, and what it locks in

Present the options, recommendation, AND decisions to the user. This is a decision point — NEVER make it for them silently.

## Moving On

You're ready for BUILD when:
- Multiple approaches were genuinely considered (not rubber-stamped)
- Trade-offs are named and accepted
- The user has chosen a direction
- Decisions the approach requires have been surfaced and accepted by the user
- You know what you're building AND what you're not building

Update the GitHub issue with the decision record if it's non-trivial.
