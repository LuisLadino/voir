# Self-Documentation Rules

You are both the author and the audience. Your default is to produce human-readable formatting. Override that default when writing documents you will later read.

## Cost Tiers

Every Claude-consumed document lives at one of three cost levels. Where a document lives determines how aggressively you filter its content.

**Tier 1 — Always-loaded (CLAUDE.md files)**
- Reread every turn, never cached. Lives below the `__SYSTEM_PROMPT_DYNAMIC_BOUNDARY__`.
- Highest recurring token cost — every token here is paid on every prompt.
- Inclusion filter: "Would Claude get this wrong without it?" If the answer is no, it doesn't belong here.
- Only: behavioral constraints, scope rules, critical context that prevents incorrect behavior.
- Every line competes for attention with every other always-loaded instruction.

**Tier 2 — On-demand (Specs, Skills, Agents, Commands)**
- Loaded when triggered by spec enforcement, skill activation, or agent spawn.
- Per-session cost, not per-prompt.
- Include: operational patterns, procedures, templates, reference examples.
- Self-documentation rules apply but no hard token budget.

**Tier 3 — Reference (Docs, Research, Archive)**
- Accessed only when specifically needed.
- Lowest cost — read once per task, if at all.
- Can be comprehensive — this is where detail lives.
- Still follow formatting rules. No wasted tokens even at low cost.

When deciding where content goes, default to the lowest tier that works. Push content down, not up. CLAUDE.md is not a knowledge base — it's a behavioral constraint file.

## Format

**No tables for linear data.** Tables are for cross-referencing — looking up a value at the intersection of a row and column. If information flows top-to-bottom or is key-value pairs, use bullet lists with bold labels.

Bad:
```
| Project | Path |
|---------|------|
| voir | ~/Repositories/Personal/voir/ |
```

Good:
```
- **voir** — `~/Repositories/Personal/voir/`
```

Tables are justified only when both row and column headers matter for lookup, like a compatibility matrix.

**No decorative separators.** `---` between sections adds tokens with no semantic value. Headers already create section breaks.

**No ASCII art or box drawings.** `┌─┐`, `│`, `└─┘` cost tokens and add no information.

**Minimal header depth.** H1 for document title. H2 for major sections. H3 sparingly. At H4 depth, flatten to **bold labels** within a section.

**No parenthetical asides.** Integrate the information or make it a separate bullet.

Bad: `SessionEnd is unreliable (doesn't fire on terminal close or trash icon)`
Good: `SessionEnd is unreliable. It doesn't fire on terminal close or trash icon.`

**Examples over prose.** Show the pattern with before/after. One concrete example teaches more than a paragraph.

## Information

**Every sentence must change behavior.** Test: if you delete this sentence, would Claude do anything differently? If no, delete it. No introductory preamble. No "this section covers..." openers. No "see also" sections listing files Glob can find.

**Tier 1 inclusion filter.** Before adding a line to CLAUDE.md, ask: "Would Claude get this wrong without this instruction?" If Claude's training and the system prompt already cover it, it doesn't need to be in CLAUDE.md. This filter is Claude Code's own internal standard for CLAUDE.md content.

**State each rule once.** One canonical location. If the same rule appears in multiple files, state it fully in one place and reference from others. Duplication wastes tokens and creates staleness.

**Don't document what's derivable.** File paths, directory structure, architecture layout are discoverable by reading the codebase. Document decisions and rules, not current state that will go stale.

**Concrete over abstract.** Every rule needs at least one example of what TO do or what NOT to do. "Be careful with files" is not actionable. "Read before editing" is.

## Token Efficiency

**Bullet lists for rules.** One rule per bullet. Nest to 2 levels maximum.

**Bold labels for key-value data.** `**name** — description` replaces a table row at lower token cost.

**Frontmatter is metadata, not prose.** Keep `description` to 1-2 sentences.

**No redundant structure markers.** Don't restate the document title in the opening paragraph. Don't add "Overview" sections that preview what the sections below already say.

**Cache awareness.** CLAUDE.md content is below the dynamic boundary — never cached, reread every prompt. Spec content is loaded on-demand. Both have cost, but CLAUDE.md cost is per-prompt while spec cost is per-edit-session. This asymmetry should drive content placement decisions.

## Scope

These rules apply to every document Claude writes for its own consumption:
- CLAUDE.md files, root and `.claude/`
- Spec files in `.claude/specs/`
- Agent definitions in `.claude/agents/`
- Skill definitions in `.claude/skills/`
- Command definitions in `.claude/commands/`
- Documentation files in `.claude/docs/`
- Memory files in `memory/`
- System prompt content

These rules do NOT apply to:
- Content written for human audiences on Luis's behalf. Voice rules govern that.
- Code files. Language-specific specs govern those.
- Git messages, PR descriptions, issue content. Those have their own conventions.

## Self-Check

Before finalizing any self-consumed document, verify:
- No tables used for linear or sequential data
- No `---` decorative separators
- No sentences that don't change behavior
- No rules duplicated across the document set
- No information derivable from reading the codebase
- Tier 1 content passes the "would Claude get this wrong?" filter
- The document follows its own rules
