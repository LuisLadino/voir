1. **Check status:**

   git diff
   \`\`\`

2. **Update documentation BEFORE committing:**
   - Find all .md files near changed files (same dir + parents)
   - Read each one
   - Update any that need it (CHANGELOG, README, etc.)
   - Report: \`[filepath]: [still accurate / updated: what changed]\`
   - Do NOT update CLAUDE.md (user-only file)

3. **Stage and commit:**
   - Use the commit format from version-control spec above
   - No Co-Authored-By for Claude
