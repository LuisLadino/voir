description: Wire project together, verify setup, generate project specs. Handles the HOW after /init-project defines the WHAT.
---

# /sync-stack

**Wire your project together and generate specs for HOW to build it.**

/init-project defines WHAT you're building. /sync-stack handles HOW:
- Installs dependencies and wires configs together
- Verifies everything is connected properly
- Generates coding specs from official docs
- Creates a system map showing how pieces connect

## Usage

```
/sync-stack                      # Full setup (install, wire, verify, generate specs)
/sync-stack prisma               # Add a specific dependency and update specs
/sync-stack --verify             # Just verify setup, don't regenerate specs
/sync-stack --custom api-conventions   # Add custom project-specific spec
```

## Core Principle

**All spec categories are treated the same.** Coding specs, config specs, architecture specs - all get:
1. Verified against official docs (context7 or official sites)
2. Populated with real content, not placeholders
3. If not configured, prompt to set it up

No category is "just project conventions" that skips verification.

## What This Does

### 1. Project Setup
- Detects package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun)
- Installs dependencies if lock file missing
- Creates config files that reference each other correctly

### 2. Wiring Verification
- Checks configs are connected (tsconfig paths, tailwind content, vite plugins)
- Validates peer dependencies are satisfied
- Ensures build pipeline will work

### 3. Spec Generation
Researches your stack via context7 and generates specs with **real patterns from official docs**. This applies to ALL categories - coding, config, architecture, design.

| Category | What it contains | Source |
|----------|------------------|--------|
| `coding/` | Language and library patterns | Official docs (React, TS, etc.) |
| `architecture/` | File structure, system map | Framework docs + detected config |
| `design/` | Implementation patterns for design system | Styling framework docs |
| `documentation/` | Code comments, docstrings | Language conventions (TSDoc, etc.) |
| `config/` | Git, testing, deployment, env | Detected from project files |

### 4. Wiring Diagram
Generates `.claude/specs/architecture/system-map.yaml` showing:
- Dependencies and their relationships
- Config file connections
- Build pipeline flow

## STEP 0: Resolve Project Specs Root

Before reading or writing any project spec, resolve where project specs live. Kit-owned specs always stay under `.claude/specs/`; curated project specs go to `project_specs_root`.

```bash
# Read .claude/specs.yaml if it exists
PROJECT_SPECS_ROOT=$(grep -E '^project_specs_root:' .claude/specs.yaml 2>/dev/null | sed -E 's/^project_specs_root:[[:space:]]*"?([^"]+)"?[[:space:]]*$/\1/')

# If unset, pick default based on mode
if [ -z "$PROJECT_SPECS_ROOT" ]; then
  if grep -q '^mode: client' .claude/kit-mode.yaml 2>/dev/null; then
    PROJECT_SPECS_ROOT="docs/specs"
  else
    PROJECT_SPECS_ROOT=".claude/specs"
  fi
fi
```

Every `.claude/specs/{coding,config,architecture,design,components,documentation}/` write path in the steps below resolves to `$PROJECT_SPECS_ROOT/...`. Stack-config stays at `.claude/specs/stack-config.yaml`, and every `file:` entry it generates is project-root-relative.

**Legacy-layout hint.** If `PROJECT_SPECS_ROOT` is not `.claude/specs` but project specs are still found under `.claude/specs/{architecture,design,config,coding,components}/`, print:

```
Detected legacy spec layout. Run '/sync-stack --migrate-specs' to opt into the tracked location.
```

Do not auto-migrate. The no-flag run only hints; `--migrate-specs` is the explicit opt-in.

## STEP 1: Read Existing Specs

First, read all existing spec files to understand current configuration.

```bash
# Find all spec files
find .claude/specs -name "*.md" -o -name "*.yaml" 2>/dev/null
```

**Read each file found.** This gives you:
- Current stack configuration (stack-config.yaml)
- Existing coding patterns (coding/*.md)
- Config settings (config/*.md)
- Any custom specs (architecture/, design/, documentation/, custom/)

**Note what exists** so you can update rather than overwrite, and preserve user customizations.

## STEP 2: Check Design System (UI Projects)

**Before generating specs, verify design decisions are established for UI projects.**

Determine if project has UI:
- Solution type is website, web app, mobile app, or desktop app
- Has component files (.tsx, .vue, .svelte, etc.)
- Has styling config (tailwind.config.*, styles/, css files)

If UI project, check for design system:

```bash
# Check for design system spec
ls .claude/specs/design/design-system.md 2>/dev/null
```

**If design system doesn't exist:**

```
DESIGN SYSTEM REQUIRED

This project has a UI but no design system is defined.

Design decisions (colors, typography, component patterns) must be established
before generating technical specs. Otherwise, specs can't enforce visual consistency.

Options:
1. Run /init-project to define design system now
2. Create .claude/specs/design/design-system.md manually
3. Skip design specs (not recommended for production UI)

How do you want to proceed?
```

**WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** before continuing.

If user chooses option 1, run /init-project's design section only, then continue.

## STEP 2b: Check Design Direction (UI Projects)

**After the design-system check, verify project design direction is captured.**

`design-system.md` covers tokens and structural decisions, owned by `/init-project`. `direction.md` captures feel, brand voice, references, anti-references, and motion posture, owned by `/design shape`. Both are expected on UI projects. `/design polish` treats `direction.md` as hard rules during pre-ship review.

Use the same UI detection as Step 2.

```bash
ls .claude/specs/design/direction.md 2>/dev/null
```

**If `direction.md` doesn't exist:**

```
DESIGN DIRECTION REQUIRED

This project has a UI but no direction.md.

design-system.md handles tokens and structural decisions via /init-project.
direction.md handles feel, references, anti-references, and motion posture
via /design shape. Both should exist for UI projects.

Without direction.md, /design polish falls back to craft floor only and
cannot enforce project-specific visual rules.

Options:
1. Run /design shape to establish direction now
2. Create .claude/specs/design/direction.md manually. See
   .claude/skills/design/references/project-spec-format.md
3. Skip. Not recommended for production UI.

How do you want to proceed?
```

**WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** before continuing.

If user chooses option 1, invoke `/design shape` and wait for completion, then continue.

## STEP 3: Project Setup (New Projects)

**If this is a new project without dependencies installed, set it up.**

### Check if setup needed

```bash
# Check for lock files
ls package-lock.json yarn.lock pnpm-lock.yaml bun.lockb 2>/dev/null
```

**If no lock file exists but package.json exists:**

```
PROJECT NOT INSTALLED

Dependencies are defined but not installed. This project needs setup.

Detected package manager: [npm/yarn/pnpm/bun based on config or preference]

Install dependencies and wire configs? (yes/no)
```

**WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE**

### If user confirms, run setup:

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
[npm install / yarn / pnpm install / bun install]
```

2. Check for missing peer dependencies and install if needed

3. Verify lock file was created

**If lock file exists:** Skip to Step 4.

## STEP 4: Detect Stack

Check for config files to detect the tech stack:

| File | Detects |
|------|---------|
| package.json | Node.js + dependencies (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) |
| tsconfig.json | TypeScript |
| next.config.* | Next.js |
| nuxt.config.* | Nuxt |
| svelte.config.* | SvelteKit |
| astro.config.* | Astro |
| vite.config.* | Vite (check plugins for framework) |
| tailwind.config.* | Tailwind CSS |
| vitest.config.* / jest.config.* | Testing framework |
| .eslintrc.* / eslint.config.* | ESLint |
| .prettierrc.* | Prettier |
| prisma/schema.prisma | Prisma |
| drizzle.config.* | Drizzle |
| pyproject.toml / requirements.txt | Python |
| Cargo.toml | Rust |
| go.mod | Go |
| Gemfile | Ruby |

**If argument provided** (e.g., `/sync-stack prisma`): Skip detection, focus on that dependency.

**If no code exists:** Ask what they're building, suggest a stack.

**Show detected stack and ask to confirm:**

```
DETECTED STACK

Framework: Next.js 14
Language: TypeScript
Styling: Tailwind CSS
Testing: Vitest
Package Manager: pnpm

Dependencies to generate specs for:
- next
- typescript
- tailwind
- vitest

Confirm? (yes / modify)
```

**WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE**

## STEP 5: Research Each Technology

For each confirmed technology, research how it actually works — not just the API, but runtime behavior, integration patterns, and common problems.

### Why research is critical

Claude's training data goes stale. Technologies update constantly. What you "know" about Astro, Motion, or Tailwind may be outdated. The point of this step is to **learn the current state** before building anything.

### Research approach: multiple sources

Use ALL available sources. No single source has complete knowledge.

**1. Context7** — Start here for API reference and official patterns.
```
Use context7 to fetch documentation for [technology].
Look for: project structure, naming conventions, common patterns, anti-patterns.
```
Context7 is good for: what functions exist, how to call them, official best practices.
Context7 is weak on: runtime behavior, cross-technology interactions, version-specific gotchas.

**2. Web search** — Use for operational knowledge that docs don't cover.
```
Search for:
- "[technology A] + [technology B] integration" (how technologies work together)
- "[technology] common problems [current year]" (what breaks in practice)
- "[technology] SSR hydration issues" (runtime behavior gotchas)
- "[technology] migration guide [version]" (what changed between versions)
- "[tech A] with [tech B] example" (real-world integration patterns)
```
Web search is good for: community-discovered gotchas, real integration examples, version-specific behavior, "I tried X and it broke because Y."
Prioritize: official docs, GitHub issues/discussions, well-known dev blogs. Deprioritize: outdated tutorials, AI-generated content, posts without dates.

**3. WebFetch on official docs** — For specific pages that context7 doesn't index well.
- Framework integration guides (e.g., Astro's React integration page)
- Migration/upgrade guides (what changed between versions)
- Advanced topics pages (SSR, hydration, performance)

### If all sources fail for a technology

```
RESEARCH INCOMPLETE

Could not find sufficient information for [technology]:
- context7: [result]
- Web search: [result]
- Official docs: [result]

Options:
1. Retry with different search terms
2. Skip this technology for now
3. Generate spec with what we have (will be marked as incomplete)
```

**WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** before proceeding.

### What to research per technology

Don't just look up "how to use [technology]." Research these specific angles:

- **Current version behavior:** What version is in package.json? What changed in recent versions?
- **Runtime lifecycle:** What happens at build time vs server time vs client time?
- **Integration with other stack technologies:** How does this technology interact with the other technologies in this project's stack?
- **Known issues:** What are the common "why isn't this working" problems?
- **Anti-patterns with explanations:** Not just "don't do X" but "don't do X because Y happens at runtime"

### Extract from research (categorized by spec type):

**For coding specs — API patterns:**
- Component/function patterns
- Import style
- Error handling patterns
- Common gotchas to avoid

**For coding specs — Runtime behavior:**
- **Lifecycle:** What happens from initialization to interactive? (e.g., Astro: SSR renders HTML → CSS applies → scripts load → framework hydrates → components become interactive)
- **SSR/SSG behavior:** If the technology involves server rendering, what HTML does the browser receive? What inline styles or attributes are added during server render? What changes after client JS executes?
- **Execution order:** When do scripts run? What's synchronous vs asynchronous? What blocks rendering?
- **Side effects:** What does the technology do that isn't obvious from the API? (e.g., Motion's `initial` prop renders as inline CSS during SSR, making content invisible before JS loads)
- **Conditional behavior:** Under what conditions does the technology behave differently? (e.g., `client:visible` uses IntersectionObserver — element must be visible in the viewport, not just in the DOM)

**For architecture specs:**
- File/folder conventions
- Project structure requirements
- Module organization

**For design specs:**
- Design token patterns (if using Tailwind, styled-components, etc.)
- Component styling conventions
- Theme structure

**For documentation specs:**
- Code comment conventions
- Docstring formats
- README patterns

## STEP 5b: Cross-Technology Interaction Constraints

**After researching each technology individually, analyze how they interact.**

Individual technology docs describe how THEIR technology works. They don't describe what happens when their technology meets another. This step catches constraints that only emerge from combinations.

### When to run this step

Run this step when the stack has **2+ technologies that share a runtime concern**:
- SSR framework + client-side library (Astro + React, Next.js + Motion)
- CSS framework + JS framework (Tailwind + React, CSS Modules + Vue)
- Build tool + framework (Vite + Svelte, Webpack + React)
- ORM + API framework (Prisma + Express, Drizzle + tRPC)

Skip this step for stacks where technologies don't interact at runtime (e.g., a Python CLI with just `click` and `requests`).

### How to identify constraints

For each **pair** of technologies in the stack, ask context7 or official docs:

1. **Lifecycle conflicts:** Do both technologies assume control over the same lifecycle phase? (e.g., both try to manage component initialization, both modify the DOM on load)
2. **SSR/hydration interactions:** If one technology server-renders and another expects client-side state, what happens during the gap? What does the user see between SSR output and full hydration?
3. **CSS/visibility interactions:** Does one technology control visibility (CSS `display`, `opacity`) while another depends on visibility to activate? (e.g., IntersectionObserver-based hydration + CSS `display:none` containers)
4. **Execution order dependencies:** Does technology A assume technology B has already run? What happens if B hasn't loaded yet?
5. **Configuration conflicts:** Do both technologies need the same config option set to different values?

### Research approach

Use web search as the primary source here. Cross-technology interactions are rarely in official docs — they live in community knowledge.

```
For each technology pair, search for:
- "[tech A] with [tech B] issues" (what breaks when combined)
- "[tech A] [tech B] integration guide [current year]" (how to wire them correctly)
- "[tech A] [tech B] gotchas" (community-discovered problems)
- GitHub issues in both repos mentioning the other technology
```

Also check:
- Official integration guides (e.g., Astro docs on React, Motion docs on SSR)
- Context7 for any integration-specific documentation
- Stack Overflow questions about the specific combination

### Document as interaction constraints

For each constraint found, document:

```markdown
### [Tech A] + [Tech B]: [Constraint Name]

**What happens:** [Observable behavior when these interact]
**Why:** [The mechanism — what each technology is doing that causes this]
**Prevent by:** [What to do instead]

Example:
- Bad: [code that triggers the problem]
- Good: [code that avoids it]
```

**Example constraints to look for:**

| Stack Combination | Common Constraint |
|---|---|
| Astro + React | `client:visible` uses IntersectionObserver — won't hydrate components inside `display:none` containers (tabs, accordions, modals) |
| Astro + Motion | Motion's `initial` prop renders as inline `style="opacity:0"` during SSR — content invisible until JS hydrates |
| Next.js + Zustand | Server Components can't use client-side stores — state must be passed as props across the boundary |
| Tailwind + dark mode | `darkMode: 'selector'` scopes to a CSS selector, `'class'` requires class on `<html>` — different integration patterns |
| Prisma + serverless | Cold starts load the Prisma Client — connection pooling needed (PgBouncer, Prisma Accelerate) |
| React + CSS transitions | React re-renders can interrupt CSS transitions mid-animation if state changes trigger unmount/remount |

These constraints become the `## Interaction Constraints` section in the generated specs (Step 8b).

## STEP 6: Scan Existing Code

If the project has existing code, scan for patterns to preserve.

### What to scan:

**File structure:**
```bash
find src -type f -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts" | head -20
```

**Component patterns:**
```bash
grep -r "export default function\|export const\|export function" src --include="*.tsx" | head -10
```

**Import style:**
```bash
grep -r "^import" src --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | head -10
```

**Test structure:**
```bash
find . -name "*.test.*" -o -name "*.spec.*" | head -10
```

### Compare with research:
- If existing patterns match best practices: document them as-is
- If existing patterns differ: note the project's convention (consistency > best practice)
- If no existing code: use researched best practices

## STEP 7: Update Config Specs

Config specs follow the same principle as coding specs: verify against official docs, no placeholders.

### Read existing templates

```bash
ls .claude/specs/config/
```

Read each file: version-control.md, deployment.md, environment.md, testing.md

### For each config spec:
1. Detect what's configured in the project
2. If configured: fetch official docs (e.g., Vitest docs, Cloudflare docs), verify spec accuracy
3. If not configured: prompt to set it up with recommendation based on stack

### Update version-control.md

Detect from project:
```bash
# Check recent commits for format
git log --oneline -10

# Check branch naming
git branch -a | head -10

# Check for hooks
ls .husky 2>/dev/null || ls .git/hooks 2>/dev/null
```

Update the template with:
- Actual commit message format used
- Branch naming convention
- Any pre-commit hooks configured

### Update testing.md

Detect from project:
```bash
# Check package.json for test scripts
grep -A5 '"scripts"' package.json | grep test

# Check test directory structure
find . -name "*.test.*" -o -name "*.spec.*" | head -5

# Check test config
ls vitest.config.* jest.config.* 2>/dev/null
```

**If no testing framework detected:**
```
TESTING NOT CONFIGURED

No test framework detected. Recommendation for this stack:
- [Framework]: Vitest (fast, Vite-native)
- [Components]: @testing-library/react
- [Environment]: jsdom

Add testing? (yes / skip)
```

If yes: install packages, fetch Vitest docs via context7, generate real testing spec.

**If testing framework detected:**
- Fetch docs for detected framework via context7
- Update spec with verified patterns
- Include test file location, commands, coverage setup

### Update deployment.md

Detect from project:
```bash
# Check for deployment configs
ls vercel.json netlify.toml fly.toml render.yaml Dockerfile docker-compose.yml 2>/dev/null
```

**If deployment platform detected:**
- Fetch platform docs (Cloudflare, Vercel, Netlify, etc.) via context7 or WebFetch
- Verify spec matches current platform requirements
- Update with build commands, environment setup, platform-specific patterns

**If no deployment config:**
- Note it's not configured
- Suggest platforms based on stack (Cloudflare for static, Vercel for Next.js, etc.)

### Update environment.md

Detect from project:
```bash
# Check for env examples
cat .env.example 2>/dev/null || cat .env.sample 2>/dev/null
```

Update the template with:
- Required environment variables
- Variable naming conventions

## STEP 8: Generate All Specs

**Use the research from Steps 5 and 5b to fill in actual content.** Don't create empty templates. Every spec should contain real patterns from official docs, including runtime behavior and interaction constraints.

### 8a: Ask which categories to generate

```
SPEC CATEGORIES

Based on your stack, these specs can be generated:

[x] coding/        - React, TypeScript, Vitest patterns
[x] architecture/  - Next.js file structure conventions
[x] design/        - Tailwind design tokens
[ ] documentation/ - No specific conventions detected

Generate all? (yes / customize)
```

### 8b: Generate coding specs

For each technology with code patterns, create `[technology]-specs.md` with **actual patterns from research**:

```markdown
# React Specs

Source: https://react.dev/learn

## Patterns

### Component Declaration
Use function components with TypeScript.

```tsx
interface ButtonProps {
  label: string;
  onClick: () => void;
}

export function Button({ label, onClick }: ButtonProps) {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{label}</button>;
}
```

### Hooks
- Call hooks at the top level, not inside conditions
- Custom hooks must start with "use"

## Runtime Behavior

### Lifecycle
[What happens from initialization to interactive — the execution sequence, not just the API]

### SSR Behavior (if applicable)
[What does the server render? What HTML does the browser receive? What changes after JS executes?]

### Side Effects
[What does this technology do that isn't obvious from the API? Inline styles added during SSR, DOM mutations, global state changes, etc.]

## Interaction Constraints

[Constraints that emerge from combining this technology with others in the stack. From Step 5b research.]

### [This Tech] + [Other Tech]: [Constraint Name]
**What happens:** [Observable behavior]
**Why:** [Mechanism]
**Prevent by:** [What to do instead]

## Anti-Patterns

- Don't use `any` type - use proper TypeScript types
- Don't mutate state directly - use setState

## Project-Specific

[Patterns found in existing code that differ from defaults]
```

### 8c: Generate architecture specs

If framework has file structure conventions, create or update `architecture/project-structure.md` with **actual conventions from docs**:

- If file exists (from /init-project): add framework-specific section
- If file doesn't exist: create it with framework conventions

```markdown
# Project Structure

Source: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing

## Directory Layout

```
app/
├── layout.tsx          # Root layout (required)
├── page.tsx            # Home page
├── globals.css         # Global styles
├── api/                # API routes
│   └── route.ts
└── [slug]/             # Dynamic routes
    └── page.tsx
```

## Conventions

### Page files
- `page.tsx` - Publicly accessible page
- `layout.tsx` - Shared UI for segment and children
- `loading.tsx` - Loading UI
- `error.tsx` - Error UI

### Component organization
- Colocate components with their routes when route-specific
- Shared components go in `components/` at project root

## Anti-Patterns

- Don't put API logic in page components - use route handlers
- Don't import server components into client components
```

### 8d: Generate design implementation specs

**The design system (colors, typography, component styles) should already exist from /init-project.**

This step generates technical specs for IMPLEMENTING that design system using the detected styling framework.

Read the existing design system:
```bash
cat .claude/specs/design/design-system.md
```

Then create `design/[framework]-implementation.md` with patterns for applying the design system:

```markdown
# [Styling Framework] Implementation

Source: [framework docs] + .claude/specs/design/design-system.md

## How to Apply Design Tokens

### Colors
[How to reference design system colors in this framework]
- Tailwind: Use custom theme colors defined in tailwind.config
- CSS Modules: Import from design tokens CSS file
- styled-components: Use theme provider values

### Typography
[How to apply typography decisions in this framework]

### Spacing
[How to apply spacing rhythm in this framework]

## Component Patterns

[Framework-specific patterns for implementing the component styles defined in design-system.md]

### Buttons
```[code example showing how to build a button matching design system]```

### Cards
```[code example showing how to build a card matching design system]```

## Anti-Patterns

- [Framework-specific things to avoid]
- Always reference design system tokens, never hardcode values
```

**If design-system.md doesn't exist:** STEP 2 should have caught this. If somehow skipped, prompt user to define design system before generating implementation specs.

### 8e: Generate documentation specs

If language/framework has doc conventions, create `code-comments.md` with **actual conventions**:

```markdown
# Code Comments

Source: https://tsdoc.org/

## When to Comment

- Public API functions - always
- Complex algorithms - explain the why
- Workarounds - link to issue/reason

## Docstring Format

Use TSDoc for TypeScript:

```tsx
/**
 * Fetches user data from the API.
 * @param userId - The unique identifier for the user
 * @returns The user object or null if not found
 * @throws {ApiError} When the API request fails
 */
export async function getUser(userId: string): Promise<User | null> {
```

## Anti-Patterns

- Don't comment obvious code (`// increment i` above `i++`)
- Don't leave TODO comments without issue links
```

### Only create what's needed

- Skip `architecture/` if no framework-specific structure (vanilla JS/TS)
- Skip `design/` if no styling framework (just plain CSS)
- Skip `documentation/` if no specific conventions found in docs
- **Never create empty templates** - only create specs with real content from research

## STEP 9: Generate Component-Scoped Specs

**Detect distinct modules in the project and generate component-level specs for each one.**

Technology specs (Step 8) tell Claude HOW to write code in a language or framework. Component specs tell Claude HOW THIS MODULE works — its architecture, patterns, decisions, and integration points.

### 9a: Detect component boundaries

Scan for top-level directories that represent distinct modules:

```bash
# Check for common component directory patterns
ls -d */ 2>/dev/null | head -20

# Look for distinct source modules
ls -d src/*/ 2>/dev/null | head -20

# Check for monorepo packages
ls -d packages/*/ apps/*/ 2>/dev/null | head -20
```

**Component indicators** — a directory is a component if it has:
- Its own entry point (index.ts, main.ts, app.ts, server.ts)
- A distinct concern (api/, frontend/, workers/, lib/, shared/)
- Its own config files (package.json in monorepos)
- Enough files to represent a module (not just 1-2 utility files)

**Common patterns to detect:**

| Pattern | What to look for |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Backend/Frontend split** | `backend/`, `frontend/`, `client/`, `server/` |
| **API layer** | `api/`, `src/api/`, `routes/`, `src/routes/` |
| **Worker/job services** | `workers/`, `jobs/`, `queues/`, `cron/` |
| **Shared libraries** | `lib/`, `shared/`, `common/`, `packages/shared/` |
| **Monorepo packages** | `packages/*/`, `apps/*/` |
| **Database layer** | `db/`, `prisma/`, `drizzle/`, `migrations/` |
| **Infrastructure** | `infra/`, `deploy/`, `terraform/` |

**If no distinct components found** (flat project structure like a simple Next.js app): skip this step. The technology specs from Step 8 are sufficient.

**If components found, show the user:**

```
COMPONENT BOUNDARIES DETECTED

Your project has distinct modules that benefit from component-scoped specs:

1. backend/     — API server (Express, 47 files)
2. frontend/    — React SPA (92 files)
3. workers/     — Background jobs (12 files)
4. shared/      — Shared types and utilities (8 files)

Generate component specs? (yes / customize / skip)
```

**WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE**

### 9b: Analyze each component

For each confirmed component, scan to understand its internals:

```bash
# Entry points
find {component}/ -maxdepth 2 -name "index.*" -o -name "main.*" -o -name "app.*" -o -name "server.*" | head -5

# Key patterns — what frameworks/libraries does this component use?
grep -r "^import" {component}/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | \
  grep -oP 'from ["\x27]([^"\x27]+)' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -15

# Architecture patterns — how is it structured?
find {component}/ -type d | head -15

# Integration points — what does it import from other components?
grep -r "from ['\"].*\.\./\.\." {component}/ --include="*.ts" | head -10
```

Also check:
- Does it have its own config files? (tsconfig, package.json, etc.)
- Does it have its own test structure?
- What ORM/DB patterns does it use?
- What state management approach? (frontend)
- What routing pattern? (API)

### 9c: Generate component specs

For each component, create `$PROJECT_SPECS_ROOT/components/{name}.md`:

```markdown
---
name: {component-name}
description: >
  Architecture and patterns for the {name} module.
  Required reading before editing files in {path}.
applies_to:
  - "{path}/**/*.ts"
  - "{path}/**/*.tsx"
category: components
---

# {Component Name}

## Purpose

{What this component does in the system. One paragraph.}

## Architecture

### Directory Structure

{scanned directory layout}

### Key Entry Points
- `{path}/index.ts` — {what it exports}
- `{path}/server.ts` — {what it starts}

### Core Patterns

{Patterns discovered from scanning the code. Examples:}

**Data Access:**
- Uses repository pattern via `{path}/repositories/`
- All DB queries go through repositories, never direct ORM calls in routes

**Routing:**
- Express router in `{path}/routes/`
- Route handlers delegate to services in `{path}/services/`

**State Management:** (frontend)
- Zustand stores in `{path}/stores/`
- Server state via React Query in `{path}/hooks/`

### Integration Points

- Imports from `shared/` for types and utilities
- Exposes API consumed by `frontend/` via REST endpoints
- Publishes events consumed by `workers/`

## Anti-Patterns

- Don't put business logic in route handlers — use services
- Don't import directly from other components' internals — use their public API
- Don't duplicate types that exist in `shared/`

## Architecture Decisions

{Any decisions discoverable from the code structure. If not obvious, leave this section for the user to fill in.}
```

### 9d: Add to stack-config.yaml

For each generated component spec, add an entry:

```yaml
specs:
  components:
    - name: backend
      file: components/backend.md
      applies_to:
        - "backend/**/*.ts"
      description: "Backend API architecture and patterns"

    - name: frontend
      file: components/frontend.md
      applies_to:
        - "frontend/**/*.tsx"
        - "frontend/**/*.ts"
      description: "Frontend SPA architecture and patterns"
```

### 9e: Verify enforcement

After generating, verify enforce-specs will pick them up:

```bash
# Test: does a backend file trigger the backend spec?
echo '{"tool_name":"Edit","tool_input":{"file_path":"backend/src/routes/users.ts"}}' | \
  node .claude/hooks/context/enforce-specs.cjs
```

If enforcement works, Claude will be required to read `components/backend.md` before editing any file in `backend/`.

## STEP 10: Generate System Map

Generate `$PROJECT_SPECS_ROOT/architecture/system-map.yaml` — a structured YAML document that maps how the project's components connect.

### Purpose

The system map is a dependency graph and change impact guide. It tells Claude: "if you change file X, what else is affected?" It gets:
- **Enforced** by enforce-specs (must read before editing project files)
- **Freshness-checked** by context agent at session start
- **Update-flagged** by phase evaluator after commits that change architecture

### What to include

Scan the project to identify:
1. **Components** — key files/modules with their imports, reads, writes
2. **Data flow** — how data moves through the system (routes, state, APIs)
3. **Config connections** — what config files reference each other
4. **Change impact rules** — "if you change X, also update Y"

### How to scan

```bash
# Detect project structure
find src -type f -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" | head -30

# Find imports and dependencies
grep -r "^import\|require(" src --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | head -20

# Find config cross-references
grep -r "tsconfig\|tailwind\|postcss\|vite" *.config.* *.json 2>/dev/null

# Find API routes / data sources
find . -path "*/api/*" -name "*.ts" -o -path "*/routes/*" -name "*.ts" | head -10
```

### Generate the YAML

```yaml
# System Map — [project name]
# Dependency graph and change impact guide.
# Read this before editing project files.
#
# Generated by /sync-stack
# Last verified: [date]

components:
  # For each key file/module:
  src/components/Button.tsx:
    purpose: Primary button component
    imports: [src/lib/utils.ts, src/styles/tokens.ts]
    used_by: [src/pages/Home.tsx, src/pages/Settings.tsx]
    if_changed:
      - Check all pages that import this component
      - Update design system spec if API changes

  src/lib/api.ts:
    purpose: API client
    imports: [src/lib/config.ts]
    used_by: [src/hooks/useData.ts, src/pages/Dashboard.tsx]
    if_changed:
      - Update API types if response shape changes
      - Check all hooks that call these functions

data_flow:
  # How data moves through the app
  - "User action → src/hooks/useData.ts → src/lib/api.ts → external API"
  - "API response → state store → component re-render"

config_connections:
  tsconfig.json:
    referenced_by: [vite.config.ts]
    paths_must_match: src/ directory structure
  tailwind.config.ts:
    content_must_include: ["src/**/*.tsx"]
    referenced_by: [postcss.config.js]

change_rules:
  - trigger: "Adding a new page/route"
    do:
      - Add to navigation component
      - Update sitemap if it exists
      - Add route test

  - trigger: "Changing API response shape"
    do:
      - Update TypeScript types
      - Update all consumers of that endpoint
      - Update tests
```

### Adapt to project type

The example above is for a web app. Adapt the structure to match the actual project:

| Project Type | Key Components | Key Connections |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Web app | Pages, components, API routes, state | Route → component → API → data |
| CLI tool | Commands, modules, config | Command → handler → output |
| Library | Public API, internal modules | Export → consumer → types |
| API server | Routes, middleware, models | Request → middleware → handler → DB |
| Static site | Pages, layouts, content | Content → template → output |

### Add to stack-config.yaml

Add the system map spec with applies_to patterns covering the project's source files:

```yaml
architecture:
  - name: system-map
    file: architecture/system-map.yaml
    applies_to:
      - "src/**/*.ts"
      - "src/**/*.tsx"
    description: "How project components connect — dependency graph and change impact guide"
```

## STEP 11: Generate CI Workflow

**Generate GitHub Actions CI workflow based on detected stack.**

### Check if CI exists

```bash
ls .github/workflows/ci.yml 2>/dev/null
```

If exists, ask: "CI workflow exists. Regenerate based on current stack? (yes/skip)"

### Generate based on stack

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with checks appropriate for the detected stack:

**Node.js projects (React, Next.js, Astro, Docusaurus, etc.):**

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  checks:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: '[npm/yarn/pnpm]'
      - run: [npm ci / yarn / pnpm install]
      - run: npm run build
      - run: npm run lint --if-present
      - run: npm test --if-present
```

**Python projects:**

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  checks:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.12'
      - run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - run: ruff check . --if-present
      - run: pytest --if-present
```

**Config/docs projects (no build):**

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  checks:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Validate YAML
        run: |
          python3 -c "import yaml; [yaml.safe_load(open(f)) for f in __import__('glob').glob('**/*.yaml', recursive=True)]"
      - name: Validate JSON
        run: |
          python3 -c "import json; [json.load(open(f)) for f in __import__('glob').glob('**/*.json', recursive=True)]"
```

### Adapt to detected stack

Use the stack detected in Step 4 to:
1. Choose the right base template
2. Set correct package manager (npm/yarn/pnpm/bun)
3. Include test command if testing framework detected
4. Include lint command if linter detected
5. Include build command if framework has one

### Enable auto-merge support

Add to the workflow:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
```

This allows the commit skill's `gh pr merge --auto` to work.

## STEP 12: Verify Wiring

**Check that all configs are actually connected properly.**

### 12a: TypeScript paths

```bash
# Check tsconfig paths exist
cat tsconfig.json | jq '.compilerOptions.paths'
# Verify those paths resolve to actual directories
```

### 12b: Tailwind content

```bash
# Check tailwind content array
cat tailwind.config.* | grep -A5 "content"
# Verify patterns match actual file locations
```

### 12c: Build script

```bash
# Try a build
npm run build 2>&1 | head -20
```

### 12d: Peer dependencies

```bash
# Check for peer dep warnings
npm ls 2>&1 | grep -i "peer"
```

### Report issues

If any verification fails:

```
WIRING ISSUES DETECTED

1. [Issue description]
   - Expected: [what should be]
   - Found: [what is]
   - Fix: [how to fix]

2. [Next issue...]

Fix these issues? (yes/no)
```

**WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** before making fixes.

## STEP 13: Create or Update stack-config.yaml

Create `.claude/specs/stack-config.yaml` if it doesn't exist, or update the existing one with:

1. **Stack details** - framework, language, styling, testing, package_manager
2. **Specs list** - each spec needs: name, file, applies_to patterns, description

The `applies_to` patterns tell enforce-specs.cjs which files require reading this spec before editing.

Example update:

```yaml
stack:
  framework: "Next.js"
  framework_version: "14"
  language: "TypeScript"
  styling: "Tailwind CSS"
  testing: "Vitest"
  package_manager: "pnpm"

specs:
  coding:
    - name: nextjs-specs
      file: coding/nextjs-specs.md
      applies_to:
        - "app/**/*.tsx"
        - "pages/**/*.tsx"
      description: "Next.js patterns and conventions"

    - name: typescript-specs
      file: coding/typescript-specs.md
      applies_to:
        - "**/*.ts"
        - "**/*.tsx"
      description: "TypeScript patterns"

    - name: tailwind-specs
      file: coding/tailwind-specs.md
      applies_to:
        - "**/*.tsx"
        - "**/*.jsx"
        - "tailwind.config.*"
      description: "Tailwind CSS patterns"

    - name: vitest-specs
      file: coding/vitest-specs.md
      applies_to:
        - "**/*.test.ts"
        - "**/*.spec.ts"
      description: "Testing patterns"

  architecture:
    - name: project-structure
      file: architecture/project-structure.md
      applies_to: []
      description: "File structure conventions"

  design:
    - name: design-system
      file: design/design-system.md
      applies_to: []
      description: "Design tokens and styles"

  config:
    - name: version-control
      file: config/version-control.md
      applies_to: []
      description: "Git conventions"
```

**applies_to patterns:**
- Use glob patterns that match files this spec governs
- `**/*.tsx` matches all .tsx files
- `app/**/*.tsx` matches .tsx files under app/
- Empty array `[]` means spec is loaded but not enforced on specific files

Only include categories that have specs. Don't add empty categories.

## STEP 14: Summary

Show what was created/updated:

```
SYNC COMPLETE

- Review specs in .claude/specs/
- Run /build to implement with these specs enforced
```

### Save state for pivot detection

After successful sync, save a hash of key files for detecting future changes:

```bash
# Create .claude/specs/.sync-state.json
{
  "lastSync": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "hashes": {
    "package.json": "[md5 hash]",
    "package-lock.json": "[md5 hash]",
    "tsconfig.json": "[md5 hash]",
    "tailwind.config.ts": "[md5 hash]"
  }
}
```

This allows future `/sync-stack` runs to detect what changed and prompt for updates.

## Error Handling

### context7 fails (network error, timeout)
STOP. Notify user. Do not proceed with web search. Ask user how to proceed.

### context7 has no docs for [tech]
Use WebFetch on official docs site only (with user approval). Note source in spec file.

### Can't detect stack
Ask user directly: "What framework/language are you using?"

### Conflicting patterns in existing code
Note the inconsistency. Ask user which pattern to standardize on.

### Spec already exists
Ask: "Update existing [tech]-specs.md? (yes/skip)"

## Adding a Single Dependency

When run as `/sync-stack [dependency]`:

1. Skip full stack detection
2. Research just that dependency
3. Check for existing patterns using it
4. Generate/update the coding spec for that dependency
5. If the dependency has architecture implications (e.g., Prisma schema location), update architecture specs too
6. Add to stack-config.yaml specs list

**Note:** Single dependency mode focuses on coding specs. Run full `/sync-stack` to regenerate architecture/design/documentation specs.

## Migrating Specs to a Tracked Location

When run as `/sync-stack --migrate-specs`, this mode moves a project from the legacy spec layout (everything under `.claude/specs/`) to the new layout where curated project specs live under `<project_specs_root>/` and only kit-owned specs stay under `.claude/specs/`.

Use this mode when:
- You're in client mode and want curated specs to commit to the project repo.
- You want project specs to travel with code commits in any mode.
- You're recovering a project where `.claude/specs/` was lost.

### Step 1: Detect Current Layout

```bash
ls .claude/specs/architecture/ .claude/specs/design/ .claude/specs/config/ \
   .claude/specs/coding/ .claude/specs/components/ 2>/dev/null
```

If none of these exist, there's nothing to migrate. Stop and inform the user.

### Step 2: Confirm Target Root

Resolve `PROJECT_SPECS_ROOT` with the same logic as STEP 0. Then show the user:

```
MIGRATION PLAN

Source: .claude/specs/{architecture, design, config, coding, components}/
Target: <project_specs_root>/...

Files to move (using git mv to preserve history):
[enumerate every file under the legacy subtrees]

Files that STAY at .claude/specs/:
- kit/*
- lenses/*
- claude-code/*
- design/craft.md
- stack-config.yaml

Stack-config.yaml file: paths will be rewritten to project-root-relative.

A README.md will be created at <project_specs_root>/ explaining the convention.

Proceed? (yes / customize root / cancel)
```

WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE.

### Step 3: Execute Migration

For each file in the legacy subtrees:

```bash
mkdir -p "$PROJECT_SPECS_ROOT/<subdir>"
git mv ".claude/specs/<subdir>/<file>" "$PROJECT_SPECS_ROOT/<subdir>/<file>"
```

`git mv` preserves history. If the project is in client mode and `.claude/` is in `.git/info/exclude`, `git mv` reports "did not match any files" because the original files were never tracked. Fall back to plain `mv`:

```bash
mv ".claude/specs/<subdir>/<file>" "$PROJECT_SPECS_ROOT/<subdir>/<file>"
```

This is the expected path for client-mode migrations: the originals were never tracked, so there's no history to preserve.

After moves, rewrite `stack-config.yaml`: every `file:` entry that pointed at a moved file gets prefixed with `$PROJECT_SPECS_ROOT/`. Use a YAML-aware rewrite (Node or python3), not sed, to avoid mangling the file.

```
# Before: file: architecture/decisions.md
# After:  file: docs/specs/architecture/decisions.md
```

### Step 4: Write Config and README

Write `.claude/specs.yaml` with the chosen `project_specs_root`. Write the README at the target root if it doesn't exist (same content as init-project STEP 5.0).

### Step 5: Verify

```bash
# All moved files exist at the new path; no stale .claude/specs/<moved-subdir>/ remain.
echo '{"tool_input":{"file_path":"src/example.ts"}}' | \
  node .claude/hooks/context/enforce-specs.cjs
# Should list specs from BOTH .claude/specs/ and project_specs_root/
```

Report:

```
MIGRATION COMPLETE

Moved N files from .claude/specs/ to <project_specs_root>/.
Updated stack-config.yaml with N rewritten paths.
Wrote .claude/specs.yaml and <project_specs_root>/README.md.

Next steps in CLIENT-MODE projects:
- Run `git status` — moved files now appear as new tracked files in the project repo.
- Commit them with the next related code change.

Next steps in PERSONAL projects:
- Nothing extra. The new layout is already live.
```

Migration is idempotent: a second run detects no legacy subtrees and reports "nothing to migrate."

## Adding Custom Project Specs

When run as `/sync-stack --custom [name]`:

Use this for internal project rules NOT covered by library documentation:
- Internal API conventions
- Company naming standards
- Security requirements
- Accessibility standards
- Business logic rules
- Any project-specific patterns

**Don't use for:** Library patterns (React, Prisma, Tailwind). Use regular `/sync-stack` for those.

### Step 1: Spec Type

Ask the user which type:

1. **coding** - Internal coding standards (`.claude/specs/coding/`)
2. **architecture** - System design rules (`.claude/specs/architecture/`)
3. **design** - Design rules (`.claude/specs/design/`)
4. **config** - Operational rules (`.claude/specs/config/`)

### Step 2: Confirm

Show: type, name, file path. Ask for confirmation.

### Step 3: Create File

Create the spec file with template:

```markdown
# [Spec Name]

## Overview

[What this spec covers]

## Patterns

### [Pattern Name]
[Description with code example]

## Anti-Patterns

- [What NOT to do] - [Why]
```

### Step 4: Update stack-config.yaml

Add the spec to the appropriate category with its applies_to patterns:

```yaml
specs:
  coding:
    - name: api-conventions
      file: coding/api-conventions.md
      applies_to:
        - "src/api/**/*.ts"
        - "src/routes/**/*.ts"
      description: "Internal API conventions"
```

Ask the user what file patterns this spec should govern. These patterns determine when Claude must read this spec before editing.

### Step 5: Generate Content (Optional)

Ask if they want help filling in the spec:

1. **Research** - Research general best practices to scaffold
2. **Manual** - Keep template for manual editing

Research sources for custom specs:
- REST/GraphQL API design guidelines
- OWASP security best practices
- WCAG accessibility standards
- Language-agnostic patterns

### Step 6: Done

Confirm the spec was created. Suggest reviewing and customizing.

## How Specs Are Used

After running `/sync-stack`:

**For /build:**
1. Claude loads `stack-config.yaml`
2. Reads all spec files listed under `specs:`
3. Specs are now in context for the work

**For enforcement (automatic):**
1. Claude attempts to edit a file
2. `enforce-specs.cjs` reads `stack-config.yaml`
3. Checks if file matches any spec's `applies_to` patterns
4. If match found, blocks edit until that spec is read
5. After reading spec, edits are allowed for that prompt

**Your specs become the rules.** The `applies_to` patterns determine which files require which specs.
