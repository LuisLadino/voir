# /verify - Specs Check

Verify code follows your specs. Use before commits or when reviewing work.

---

## STEP 1: Load Configuration

Read `.claude/specs/stack-config.yaml`.

If not found, tell the user to run `/init-project` or `/sync-stack` first.

---

## STEP 2: Load Specs

Read all specs listed in `specs:` section of stack-config.yaml.

For each directory listed (coding, config, etc.), read all files under that directory.

**Only check against specs that actually exist.** Don't assume patterns - read them from the files.

---

## STEP 3: Run Tooling Checks

Run quality gates listed in `quality:` section of stack-config.yaml.

For each enabled gate, detect the command from package.json scripts:
- format → look for `format` or `format:check` script
- lint → look for `lint` script
- type_check → if TypeScript project, run `npx tsc --noEmit`
- test → look for `test` script
- build → look for `build` script

**Only run gates that are enabled.** Skip commented-out gates.

Report pass/fail for each.

---

## STEP 4: Code Review Against Specs

For each specs file loaded in STEP 2, check the codebase:

1. **Read the spec** - Extract the specific rules/patterns
2. **Search the code** - Use Grep/Read to find relevant code
3. **Compare** - Does the code follow the documented pattern?
4. **Report** - List violations with file:line, what's wrong, what the spec says

**Important:** Only check rules that are explicitly in the user's specs files. Don't invent rules.

---

## STEP 5: Report

### If all checks pass:
```
VERIFICATION PASSED

Stack: [framework] + [language]
Specs checked: [list files]
Tooling: format ✓, lint ✓, types ✓, build ✓, tests ✓

Ready for commit.
```

### If violations found:
```
VERIFICATION FAILED

[X] violations found:

1. [file:line] - [what's wrong]
   Spec: [which file, which rule]
   Fix: [how to fix]

...

Fix violations and run /verify again.
```

## Notes

- This command reads YOUR specs, not a hardcoded checklist
- If your specs are empty, there's nothing to verify beyond tooling
- Add specs with `/add-spec` or `/sync-stack`
