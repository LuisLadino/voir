description: Start any coding task. Loads stack config and specs, gathers requirements interactively, then executes.

# /start-task - Interactive Task Builder

## STEP 1: Load Stack Configuration

Read `.claude/specs/stack-config.yaml`. If missing, ask user to run `/init-project` or `/sync-stack` first.

**Extract:**
- Stack: framework, language, styling, testing, package_manager
- Specs: list of active spec files to load
- Project settings: import_alias, components_dir, tests_dir (use these when creating files)
- Quality gates: which checks to run

If `.claude/specs/project-guidelines.md` exists, read it for quality/testing/accessibility requirements.

### Check for New Dependencies

Scan dependencies (package.json or equivalent). Compare against specs files in `.claude/specs/coding/`.

If a major dependency has no specs file (e.g., added Prisma but no `prisma-specs.md`), ask:

"[dependency] doesn't have a specs file. Create one? (yes/no/later)"

If yes, generate specs for that dependency before continuing.

---

## STEP 2: Understand the Task

Ask clarifying questions about what the user wants:
1. What exactly should this do? (if ambiguous)
2. Where should this go? (page/component/directory)
3. Specific requirements? (styling, data source, interactions, edge cases)
4. Existing code to modify or reference? (if refactoring/extending)

---

## STEP 3: Determine Scope & Read Specs

### Find and Load Specs

Read all specs listed in stack-config.yaml `specs` field.

**Load everything listed:**
- All files under `specs.coding` (framework, language patterns)
- All files under `specs.config` (version-control, testing, etc.)
- Any other directories listed (architecture, design, documentation, custom)

**Only load what exists.** If a directory isn't in stack-config.yaml, skip it.

**For task-specific specs:** If task involves UI, check for design specs. If task involves tests, check for testing specs. Load relevant specs based on task keywords.

---

## STEP 4: Show Complete Specs Check

**PAUSE FOR REVIEW** - Show the user a complete checklist covering:
- Stack details (framework, language, styling, testing, package manager)
- Task summary and approach
- All loaded specs files (from stack-config.yaml)
- Key patterns being applied from each spec
- Files to create/modify
- Quality checks that will run (format, lint, type-check, build, test)

Ask user to approve: "yes" to proceed, "no" to revise, "explain [item]" for details.

**WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE**

### If user says "no" or has concerns:
Ask what to change, update the plan, re-show the checklist.

### If user says "explain [item]":
Explain the specific item, then re-show the checklist.

---

## STEP 5: Execute Task Following Specs

Once approved, implement following loaded specs:

1. **Framework patterns** - Use patterns from `[framework]-specs.md`, match existing code style
2. **Language rules** - Follow `[language]-specs.md` strictly, avoid listed anti-patterns
3. **Styling** - Follow `[styling]-specs.md`, match existing component styles
4. **Organization** - Follow `file-structure.md` for placement and naming
5. **Documentation** - Add comments per `code-comments.md`, document public APIs per `component-docs.md`
6. **Testing** - Write tests per `testing-specs.md` using configured test framework

---

## STEP 6: Verification Phase

Run quality checks listed in `stack-config.yaml` under `quality:`.

For each enabled gate, detect the correct command from package.json scripts or project config:

| Gate | How to detect command |
|------|----------------------|
| format | Check for `format` script in package.json |
| lint | Check for `lint` script in package.json |
| type_check | If TypeScript, run `npx tsc --noEmit` |
| test | Check for `test` script in package.json |
| build | Check for `build` script in package.json |

**Only run gates that are enabled in stack-config.yaml.** Skip commented-out gates.

Report pass/fail results to user.

### If Any Check Fails
Show error details, analyze the issue, apply fix, re-run all checks. Only proceed when ALL checks pass.

---

## STEP 7: Completion

Show the user:
- What was built
- Files created/modified
- Verification results (format, lint, type-check, build, tests)

Ask: "Want to commit these changes? (yes/no)"

**If yes:** Read `.claude/specs/config/version-control.md`, generate commit message, stage and commit.

**If no:** Done. User can commit later.

---

## STEP 8: Next Steps

Suggest: `/learn` to understand the code, `/verify` for deeper check, or `/start-task` for another task.

---

## ENFORCEMENT

**CRITICAL RULES:**

1. **Always load stack-config.yaml first** - Cannot proceed without knowing the stack
2. **Must show Specs Check** - Show complete checklist, wait for user approval, never skip
3. **Cannot modify approach without approval** - If "no", revise and re-show checklist; only proceed on explicit "yes"
4. **All verification must pass** - Format, lint, type-check, build, test; fix failures and re-run
5. **Quality checklist before "done"** - Run all verification checks, no shortcuts

---

## Tool Usage

**Use Read or Grep for:** Loading stack-config.yaml, finding custom specs, locating framework-specific patterns, checking architectural decisions, finding existing similar code.

**Use web_search for:** Verifying current best practices, checking framework documentation, finding recent patterns.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Can't find stack-config.yaml** - Run `/init-project` to create stack configuration
- **Specs don't match code** - Review `.claude/specs/`, update specs files, verify `specs:` list in stack-config.yaml
- **Verification failing** - Fix the specific error shown; update configuration if rules don't match needs
- **Wrong framework patterns** - Verify framework name/version in stack-config.yaml, run `/sync-stack` to regenerate if needed
